## San Francisco Movie Locations

[Demo](https://damp-beach-26830.herokuapp.com/)

Single React page Â application that shows on a map locations in San Francisco, where movies have been filmed. There is an ability to find a movie by name or by using basic search filter (by year or title). I used Google maps API in order to get the coordinates of the street name.
